# Project Title
Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## Overview
I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyse sales performance, profitability, and customer behaviour. The dashboard offers clear insights into revenue drivers, top-performing segments, and monthly sales trends.

## Business Problem / Question
The business wanted to answer:
•	Which product categories and segments drive the most sales and profit?
•	Who are the top profitable customers?
•	What is the trend of sales over time?
•	Where are discounts being applied the most?

## Tools & Skills Used
•	Excel: Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Data Cleaning, Dashboard Design
•	Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, KPI Reporting, Trend Analysis

## Process
1.	Data Cleaning: Checked for duplicates, standardized fields, and formatted sales records.
2.	Analysis: Used pivot tables to calculate KPIs such as total sales, profit, discount, and quantity.
3.	Visualization: Designed dynamic charts (pie, bar, and line) to display:
•	Sales by Category (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies)
•	Profit by Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
•	Top 5 Customers and Discounts by Sub-Category
•	Trend of Monthly Sales
4.	Interactivity: Added slicers for Region, Shipping Mode, and Order Date.
   
## Key Insights
•	Technology was the top contributor, generating 37% of sales revenue.
•	Consumer segment led with over $1.49M in profit.
•	Binders had the highest discounts applied, reducing overall profitability.
•	Sales showed seasonal spikes in March, November, and December.

## Recommendations
•	Reduce high discounting in Binders and Phones to improve margins.
•	Focus marketing efforts on Technology products, the highest-performing category.
•	Strengthen engagement with top profitable customers (e.g., Adrian Barton, Hunter Lopez).
•	Prepare for seasonal demand spikes by adjusting inventory and promotions in Q2 and Q4.
